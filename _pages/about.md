I am a Ph.D. student in Engineering Science at the University of Trento, Italy, with a strong focus on medical imaging, deep learning, and AI-driven diagnostics. My research bridges computational modeling, multimodal data integration, and clinical applications, aiming to create robust and interpretable AI tools for healthcare.

I hold a Master’s Degree in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) from the University of Trento, where my thesis focused on the **automatic analysis of perivascular spaces in Parkinsonian patients from brain MRI images**. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a thesis on **detection and localization of deep video inpainting**. I also completed an exchange semester at Charles University in Prague, exploring international research perspectives in computational sciences.





### 🔬 My primary research interests:  

- **Medical Image Generation & Multimodal Diagnostics**: Developingdeeplearningmodelsthatintegrate medical imaging and clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy and generalization. Focus on segmentation and generative approaches for data augmentation, supporting robust multimodal diagnostic pipelines.
- **Adaptive & Self-Evolving AI Models**: Designing adaptive, self-evolving architectures to enhance model robustness, reliability, and clinical validity. Emphasis on interpretable AI to support safe and meaningful collaboration between AI systems and healthcare professionals.

🌱 When I'm not doing research, you’ll probably find me travelling, doing pilates, or walking somewhere with a podcast on.

### 💜 A Little More About Me
<img src="assets/img/tecna.jpg" alt="Tecna Inspiration" style="width:100px; float:left; margin-right:15px;"> I’ve always seen a bit of myself in **Tecna**. Not because someone chose her—no one ever really did—but because she was a woman in STEM long before anyone appreciated what that meant.  
She was driven by curiosity, innovation, and a kind of quiet determination that wasn’t always understood at first.  
Today, people finally recognize her passion for technology and her potential. And in many ways, I feel the same: growing into my space, embracing my strengths, and shaping my path with confidence, creativity, and a deep love for science.
